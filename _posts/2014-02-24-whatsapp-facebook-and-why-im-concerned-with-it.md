title: WhatsApp + Facebook, and why I'm concerned with it.
---

A few days ago, we were surprised by the news that [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) acquired the popular mobile messaging platform [WhatsApp](http://www.whatsapp.com/) for a [whopping $19bn](http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5427332/facebook-is-buying-whatsapp).

I, for one, was shocked about this news. But not only because of the [unreasonable amount](http://thingsthatarecheaperthanwhatsapp.tumblr.com/) the deal went through.

This concerns me because of the way Facebook practices the privacy of its users, commonly utilizing their user’s information ([even dead ones](http://readwrite.com/2012/12/11/why-are-dead-people-liking-stuff-on-facebook)) for ads. And we never forget the day Facebook tried to fuck [Instagram](http://instagram.com/) over by giving themselves the consent to sell their user’s photos for advertisements.

That said, even though the WhatsApp folks [promised](http://blog.whatsapp.com/index.php/2014/02/facebook/) that they won’t change anything, it still concerns me that Facebook might screw this up and decided to “pull an Instagram”. And they might probably [do some more uncool things](http://www.forbes.com/sites/maseenaziegler/2014/02/23/5-uncool-things-that-facebook-could-do-to-whatsapp/) to it.

I’m currently scouring the Internet for some alternatives. And currently I found [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) to be a viable replacement, as compared to WhatsApp, it’s totally free, doesn’t require any subscription fee, has a nice encrypted messaging feature, and the like.

But then again, my gullible friends that I commonly connect with will probably stick to using WhatsApp, whatever the cost. And persuading all of them to switch is probably the hardest thing you will ever do.
