So I've been thinking recently, I do loads of things other than web design. I do photography, I play games, I do graphic design works, and all that.

I have two cameras, a Sony Alpha A230 DSLR, and an Olympus PEN Lite E-PL5. I have a [500px](http://500px.com/resir014) and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/resir014/) page where you can take a look at the photos that I took for the past few years.

I also do some random, weird design works and such, sometimes by request, and most of the time out of sheer boredom. It's been lying on my [Tumblr](http://resir014.tumblr.com/tagged/resir014) page for quite a while now.

What I've been thinking of doing is that I'm also planning to showcase those other stuffs that I also work on in this GitHub page. I'll start by putting a separate page for my photography works.

Although it may seem an easy job, but it's kind of a pain right now, mostly on changing parts of the code, and restructuring the Jekyll collections (hell, they're not even production capable right now), plus with me being stressed out with other stuffs for the past few weeks, I find myself not being in the mood to code at most times.

So many things have happened in the past few weeks, and I've just recently slowly regaining my composure and all that. So these changes might come in a little slower. I don't know, we'll see.
