title: I take my words back.
---

Recently, [I've been criticising](https://twitter.com/resir014/status/528369240454074368) our newly appointed Minister of Communications and Information (Menkominfo), Rudiantara, for [deciding to resume the government-run "Internet Positif" internet filtering program](http://tekno.kompas.com/read/2014/11/06/1118028/Menkominfo.Pornografi.Langkahi.Dulu.Mayat.Saya), much to the dismay of Indonesian netizens.

As always, I kept alongside my stance that any forms of filtering on the Internet is terrible, and the Government should've come with a more educative approach rather than taking the improperly executed preventive approach by being triger-happy in blocking these so-called "negative" contents on the Internet from public access.

But recently [Tech in Asia covered the talk given by Rudiantara himself](http://id.techinasia.com/menkominfo-rudiantara-pornografi-pemblokiran-komik-manga-yahoo-tutup/) on the 15th anniversary celebration of Indonesia's largest forum, Kaskus. And I could really say, he does have some common sense.

Sure, it might be a slight annoyance for us having to deal with circumvention techniques just to watch a video on Vimeo or browse Reddit, but he's actually slowly working towards fighting internet illiteracy in Indonesia.

He also pointed out that education of the Netiquette is important alongside the preventive acts taken right now, and if the Indonesian public is educated enough to know the etiquettes of browsing the Internet, then those preventive actions will no longer be required.

In other words: I take my words back. Sorry, Mr. Rudi.
