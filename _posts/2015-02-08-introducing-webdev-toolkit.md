title: Introducing Webdev Toolkit
---

[Webdev Toolkit](https://github.com/resir014/Webdev-Toolkit) is a simple and lightweight debugging tool for developing HTML and CSS-based websites, based on [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). I've started working on this project a month ago, but I kept holding back on it until recently. It was originally created using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), then it was later rewritten in Gulp.

The features that are available are currently pretty limited. It has all the basic CSS cleaning tools, like CSScomb (sorts CSS declarations) and Autoprefixer (adds vendor prefixes for CSS declarations where necessary).

I have some interesting new features planned for the future, including real-time Jekyll site building, JS debugging tools, and also other things like SASS compiling, but this will have to wait time until I get more time in my hands.
