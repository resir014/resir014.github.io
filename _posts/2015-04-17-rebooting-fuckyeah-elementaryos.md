title: Rebooting fuckyeah-elementaryos
---

A few years ago, I've grown tired of Windows XP. Being a low-budget student and having no way to purchase a newer Windows licence, I decided to try out Linux. I've decided to research for a distro that I could possible use, then I discovered [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/).

I gave it a whirl on my old desktop, and it was simply one of the best experience I've ever had trying out a Linux distro. Its beautiful design has sure made me smile.

So with this new-found love, I set up a Tumblr bloc called [fuckyeah-elementaryos](http://fuckyeah-elementaryos.tumblr.com/). It had garnered much attention, it even got mentioned by one of the elementary developers. But unfortunately as time went by I had become lost in time and I'm not using my old desktop regularly anymore so I couldn't make much updates to the blog. Until now.

Thanks to the wonderful wonders of virtual machines, and with the new release of elementary dropping earlier this week, I can finally run elementary without having to risk wiping my current daily driver. And with more sufficient backup in writing I have finally found the power to revive the blog.

Of course, there also have been other, more relevant community sites popping up like [Elementary Now](http://www.elementarynow.com/), which makes it pretty safe to assume that we're just going aim for the niche Linux-users-on-Tumblr folks. There are like a handful of us, you know.
