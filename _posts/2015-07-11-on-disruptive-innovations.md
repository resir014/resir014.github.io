Recently, a massive service outage occurred on the popular messaging app Telegram. The outage was caused by a series of DDoS attacks were targeted towards Telegram's servers.

Of course, this caused some annoyance to some users, especially to me, where most of my day-to-day communications rely on Telegram. Some even lost the ability to connect at all.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An ongoing DDoS is causing connection issues for our users in India and South East Asia. We&#39;re hard at work fighting back.</p>&mdash; Telegram Messenger (@telegram) <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/619451363559350272">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

The Telegram team was quick to jump in and fight these attackers, but four hours later, it escalated.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alright, somebody seems really pissed ‚Äî the DDoS is now global, affecting Telegram users worldwide.</p>&mdash; Telegram Messenger (@telegram) <a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/619515927353278464">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

Now, this is the point where I started wondering, who might this certain "somebody" be? Turns out, I didn't have to look any further for the answer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Telegram was kicked out from Play Store for a few hours today due to <a href="https://twitter.com/NAVER_LINE">@naver_line</a>&#39;s actions. Now there&#39;s a massive DDoS on our Asian cluster.</p>&mdash; Pavel Durov (@durov) <a href="https://twitter.com/durov/status/619486763032182784">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

Now *this* might be something worth grabbing a bag of popcorns for, I thought. So I dove deep into this.

As of now, there are still very limited sources pointing to what LINE might have done to Telegram that made the app got pulled out of the Play Store for a few hours, but the resulting DDoS attack seemed suspicious.

Could LINE be behind all this?

## Digression: Marketing-focused crap make apps feel bloated

There comes a time where a piece of technology that might change the way we think about something comes along. And recently, we've been seeing the rise of a popular messaging app called Telegram.

Telegram has always been a great piece of messaging tool. As said earlier, it has *everything* that a messaging app needs, and *nothing else*. Its distributed network of servers enable sending messages faster than any other competing messaging apps in the market.

Meanwhile, LINE's marketing-focused features make it popular amongst Asian teens, especially here in Indonesia, where *every single phone* that you come across might have LINE installed on it already. Even I felt the pressure to install LINE on my phone, else I will lose track of college, because *all* of my class' communications rely on LINE.

The reason I hated LINE has always been its marketing-focused features. Official accounts, timeline, LINE apps, you name it. All of these just hogs the app down even further, causing the app to perform worse on lower-end devices.

There are also another (probably dying) alternative called WhatsApp. I still liked WhatsApp before Telegram came along. However, it was recently bought by Facebook, so that raised a red flag for people concerned about privacy. Though I still used it back then as nothing significant changed even though under new ownership.

Unfortunately, WhatsApp's services has become more and more unsatisfactory as time goes by. Messages will take a long time to send, sometimes even taking *a whole minute* before it was finally sent to a recipient, and the new WhatsApp Web didn't really help much at all, as you will *still* need your phone connected to the Internet for it to work.

So I needed a new alternative.

## Disrupting the disruptive

Which was why I hailed Telegram when it came along. I've been using Telegram a lot. I even recommended it to some friends. I tried it out, at first, to vent my frustrations at WhatsApp for becoming slower and slower over time. Needless to say, I love what the team at Telegram have been doing.

It does the job well as a messaging app, and it has *everything* that you need for a good messaging app, and nothing else. No marketing-focused crap, no useless content, just an amazing piece of messaging app that is super fast and works on *all* of your devices.

Unfortunately, every piece of disruptive innovations that came along will pose as a threat, especially to companies who will feel threatened that they will lose their primary market. And they could go to... exciting lengths to put its new competition out of business.

Which is definitely the scenario that LINE faces right now. LINE holds the market for instant messaging, especially for countries in the SEA area, like Indonesia. LINE might have felt threatened with Telegram's existence, and seeing the recent surge of Telegram users, they decided to whatever they could to try and put Telegram out of service, by making the Play Store take down Telegram for a few hours.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Telegram grew 3 times in terms of user activity within the last two months alone. No wonder competitors freak out ‚òùÔ∏èüòÄ</p>&mdash; Pavel Durov (@durov) <a href="https://twitter.com/durov/status/619501642199793665">July 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

Now, it was still unsure what LINE did to take Telegram down, and there were still not so much evidence that points out that the resulting DDoS attacks could have come from LINE itself.

But seeing the whole context of the entire issue, it *might* be likely that LINE was the one responsible for these attacks.
