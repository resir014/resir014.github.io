In case you've been living under a rock lately, Google has recently unveiled their new logo and brand identity.

It was a really neat change, and even though I had doubts about it at first, I've come to terms with it, even had started loving it. If you haven't already, go read the [Google Design case study](https://design.google.com/articles/evolving-the-google-identity/) on this rebrand, and the [type specimen](https://storage.googleapis.com/g-design/static/product-sans-specimen.pdf) of their new corporate typeface, Product Sans. They're amazing.

I've also been enjoying the positive reception the logo has been getting in the past day. I'm a frequent visitor of [UnderConsideration's "Brand New"](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/), and while looking through their review of the Google rebrand, I came across this:

>The impressive thing about [the elements] is that all three scream Google on their own — even the dots, simply by being the Google colors. You won’t mistake them for Microsoft dots, that’s for sure.

Well, Armin, hate to break it to you, but both Microsoft and Google have *pretty* similar colours on their logo.

No, really. They share the similar base colours of red, yellow, green, and blue, with differing shades. You actually gave me an idea as well.

So without further ado, please enjoy this Brand Crossover of Microsoft and Google, that was crappily put together in 5-10 minutes with a copy of GIMP that never works.
