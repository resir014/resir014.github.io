[@everyjs](https://twitter.com/everyjs) is a Twitter bot inspired by [@everyword](https://twitter.com/everyword). All it does is take a list of every word there is, and append ".js" to it.

The idea originally came from a Twitter post, which was sadly deleted. I had every intention of setting this up when that tweet was published, though I never actually got around to setting it up until late December 2015.
