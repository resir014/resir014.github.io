## Project Description

Telegram Stickers Directory is a website dedicated to curating and promoting beautiful, cute, and fun stickers for Telegram Messenger. We're doing our best to keep this directory updated daily for your enjoyment.

## Details

* Co-developed with [dankmau5](https://twitter.com/dankmau5).
* Design is based on a heavily-modified version of [Poole](http://getpoole.com), with added responsive grid elements from [Primer](https://primercss.io).
* Design inspiration comes from something you would see in a stickers store on most messenger apps, where you can search for, preview, and download sticker packs.
* Page contents are static and generated from Jekyll.
