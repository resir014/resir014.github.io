Hi, my name's Resi Respati. I'm usually known on the internets as resir014. Just call me Resi, or whatever. I'm an 20-year-old Indonesian college student living in Jakarta.

I am a huge motorsports fan. I've been following Formula 1 ever since I was at elementary school. I am also a shitty photographer, a PC gamer, and sometimes, an aviation enthusiast.

I am also an aspiring web developer. I self-learned HTML and CSS when I was in high school, and I have designed several Tumblr themes for my side blogs, which I still actively maintain.

## About this website.

This Jekyll website, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses a heavily-modified version of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), licensed under MIT, and is developed on a mid-range laptop I basically use everyday, from doing university works, to playing games.

Aside from some Google Analytics tracking code, no JavaScript is present on this website. And no, it's not due to [ethical reasons](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html) either. It's just that I'm not really good at JavaScript yet.

## Stalk me.

If you want to get in touch with me, be it for web design works, questions on open-source development, or even just to say hi, feel free to do so.
