Hi, call me Resi! I'm a 20-year-old Indonesian college student currently living in Jakarta.

I'm an aspiring web developer. I basically self-learned HTML and CSS back in high school. I've done quite a few little design projects for my friends' websites, and I have designed several Tumblr themes for my side blogs, which I still actively maintain.

I also have a number of other interests, including video games, motorsports, photography, and music, and I'm also trying my best to reflect these interests on my website.

## About this website.

This Jekyll website, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses a heavily-modified version of [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), licensed under MIT, and is developed on a mid-range laptop I basically use everyday, from doing university works, to playing games.

Aside from some Google Analytics tracking code, no JavaScript is present on this website. And no, it's not due to [ethical reasons](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html) either. It's just that I'm not really good at JavaScript yet.
