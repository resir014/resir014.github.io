Hi, call me Resi! I'm a web developer.

I started getting into web development when I self-learned HTML and CSS back in high school. I currently work as a junior web developer for [CekAja.com](https://www.cekaja.com/), a well-known player in the Indonesian fintech industry.

My other interests include, video games, motorsports, photography, and music. I keep a catalogue of interests on my [tilde.town page](https://tilde.town/~resir014/). Be sure to check them out, we might have some things in common!

## Stalk me.

I *might* do some freelance work over time, so if you want to get in touch with me, even if you just want to say hi, feel free to do so.

## Email

Due to the increasing email spam that I get nowadays, you will have to solve this simple puzzle in order to get my email address:

```
echo 'C6D:C_`co8>2:=]4@>' | tr '!-~' 'P-~!-O'
```

## About this website

This [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) uses a slightly-modified version of [Roundabout](http://blvd.space/roundabout), a theme initially designed to be the base of all my websites. It's also available for everyone, so feel free to give it a try!
